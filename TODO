Measure "coverage" of gt->ph function: What proportion of the positive
part of the phenotype fitness landscape is covered by the range of the
gt->ph function?

Make coverage itself the genotype fitness function and see what evolves.

Make a "hill" fitness function and combine it with "columns": like bumps,
but the fitness landscape is a bunch of columns separated by a "sea" of
zero that must be jumped. Can we evolve organisms that jump from column
to column?

Another node param: Ignore previous activation.

Try disallowing zero-fitness organisms from reproducing.

Run another big parameter sweep.

TOOL: Watch spreading activation of a given organism. See how it changes
as you turn knobs or make small changes to the graph.

Log the value of each mutation.

Do SIGMOID nodes tend to have more inputs than CLAMP_ONLY nodes?

Generate large number of mutations from one organism. See how many are
improvements. See how the proportion of improvements changes. See what
factors affect that proportion.
