Measure "coverage" of gt->ph function: What proportion of the positive
part of the phenotype fitness landscape is covered by the range of the
gt->ph function?

Make coverage itself the genotype fitness function and see what evolves.

Make a "hill" fitness function and combine it with "columns": like bumps,
but the fitness landscape is a bunch of columns separated by a "sea" of
zero that must be jumped. Can we evolve organisms that jump from column
to column?

Another node param: Ignore previous activation.

Try disallowing zero-fitness organisms from reproducing.

Another big parameter sweep.

TOOL: Watch spreading activation of a given organism. See how it changes
as you turn knobs or make small changes to the graph.

Command-line option to enable/disable/name the ancestors file.

Log the value of each mutation.

Do SIGMOID nodes tend to have more inputs than CLAMP_ONLY nodes?
