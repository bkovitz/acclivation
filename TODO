Measure "coverage" of gt->ph function: What proportion of the positive
part of the phenotype fitness landscape is covered by the range of the
gt->ph function?

Make coverage itself the genotype fitness function and see what evolves.

Make a "hill" fitness function and combine it with "columns": like bumps,
but the fitness landscape is a bunch of columns separated by a "sea" of
zero that must be jumped. Can we evolve organisms that jump from column
to column?

Another node param: Ignore previous activation.

Try disallowing zero-fitness organisms from reproducing.

Run another big parameter sweep.

Do SIGMOID nodes tend to have more inputs than CLAMP_ONLY nodes?

Generate large number of mutations from one organism. See how many are
improvements. See how the proportion of improvements changes. See what
factors affect that proportion.

- add simple means of graph editing so we can make changes and watch what
  happens
