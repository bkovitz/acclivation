\begin{abstract}
Simple spreading-activation networks are shown to exhibit acclivation of a
``virtual fitness landscape''. That is, the fitness function faced by part of
the genome, when the remainder of the genome is held constant, becomes
progressively more smoothly sloped, or hill-shaped.

Applied directly to the phenotype, the original fitness function is filled
with traps and local optima. The topology of the spreading-activation network
experiences indirect selective pressure to make the fitness landscape become
less rugged as seen by a numerical vector that is fed into the network.
The evolving topology exploits regularities in the original fitness
function, such as a ``ridge'' and regularly spaced ``bumps'', to make it
easier for the vector to navigate the fitness landscape by simple
hill-climbing.

This shows that under appropriate conditions, complex \mbox{epistasis} and
non-locality of genotype--phenotype mapping can improve evolvability. These
conditions are typical of those found in nature, where behavior and phenotypes
are produced mainly by cascades of activity through a graph and coordination
among the parts of the phenotype is a precondition of successful survival and
reproduction.
