Toward a Theory of Multilevel Evolution: Long-Term Information Integration Shapes the Mutational Landscape and Enhances Evolvability
- discusses increased evolvability separte from population diversity
   "However, the increase of evolvability is essentially different from the 
   increase in population variability due to an increase of neutrality. In
   the examples discussed here, evolution actually increases (the effect of)
   mutational changes “in the right direction."

Evolution of Evolvability in Gene Regulatory Networks
Crombach and Hogeweg
https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000112
- environment changes over time
- complex gene regulatory networks
- "We show that the population evolves towards genotype-phenotype mappings that
  allow for an orchestrated network-wide change in the gene expression pattern,
  requiring only a few specific gene indels. The genes involved are hubs of the
  networks"

Feed-Forward Loop Circuits as a Side Effect of Genome Evolution
- Interesting link between certain structures and molecular biology:
  feed-forward loop circuits- top-level node A conntected to B which is in turn
  connected to C,D,E,F, but A is also directly connected to each of C,D,E,F.
  Do we see anything like this?

A system for studying evolution of life-like virtual organisms
- Claim is that "virtual cells" form
- (https://biologydirect.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1745-6150-1-23)
- discussion of jumping peaks
  1) Multiple peaks and ridges
  "The best way to describe this hypothesis is to consider evolutionary process
  as climbing of peaks on the fitness landscape. If we imagine that organisms
  with small and large genomes climb the same mountain by hopping from peak to
  peak or by following ridges on the fitness landscape, then at the end all of
  them will both reach the same highest peak and achieve the same level of
  fitness, as it appears to be the case (Fig. 6B)."
